# üìò An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python (ISLP)

Welcome to the **ISLP** companion repository! This book provides a practical and accessible introduction to statistical learning using **Python**, focusing on **conceptual clarity**, **hands-on labs**, and **real-world data**. It is based on the popular "ISLR" text, adapted to Python.

## üìñ Overview

**Statistical Learning** is a key set of tools for understanding and predicting data patterns. This book covers both traditional methods (like linear regression) and modern machine learning techniques (like deep learning), all with a focus on **applications over theory**.

- Authors: Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jonathan Taylor  
- Python Labs included in every chapter  
- Uses real datasets via the `ISLP` Python package
